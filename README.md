**Introduction:**

The Project aims at building a Software System using Data Structures to Control and Co-ordinate the motion of any Remote Controlled aviation device 

The system will use simple data structures such as stacks to control the drone's motion and navigate through predefined locations.

The navigation control system will have applications in various fields, such as surveillance, delivery, search and rescue, agriculture, inspection, and mapping. It will help reduce human error, increase efficiency, and improve safety in navigation operations.

Once the software-based system is tested and optimized, it can be integrated with the hardware components of a navigation device for real-world implementation.

**Importance:**

Efficient organization of data

Real-time response

Safer operations

Integration with other systems

Improved decision-making

Overall, a navigation control system is made using data structures in C can improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of navigation operations.

**Programming Concepts:**

STRUCTURE

WHILE LOOP

SWITCH CASE

ARRAY

FUNCTIONS

STACK ( PUSH & POP )

**Algorithm:**

Defining a structure to store commands and values.

Defining an array to act as the stack and a top variable.

Defining functions for pushing commands and values, for executing commands and monitoring the droneâ€™s status.

In the main function, taking input for no. of commands.

Lastly continuing the main function by execution of the push function in a for loop , the execution of the commands according to the popped command and finally the monitoring function.

**Output:**

**Conclusion:**

The project demonstrates the potential of using simple data structures and algorithms in C to develop a software-based drone control system.  

The system uses push and pop functions to control the motion and navigate through predefined locations, without the integration of complex functions like altitude or GPS.

The project shows the importance of applying data structures and algorithms in real-world applications, and it can inspire further research and development in this area.

We were able to learn the concepts of Data Structures thoroughly by using them in the code and finding their real life applications

**Future Scope:**
